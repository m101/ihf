2012-02-19
This tool is under heavy development, and not functionnal yet
The follwing README is here to present the first goal that we
want to achieve
----

This tools allows you to have a full bi-directionnal connection
over state-less request based protocols like HTTP.

It's composed of a client (cli) and a server (srv).
For example you can have a setup where the client (cli) connects
to a JSP servlet executing the server (srv).

srv can execute commands on the server (for reverse shell).
cli sends commands to srv over HTTP.

In the future, srv is meant to be able to be used also as a proxy,
and any protocol should be supported between cli and srv.
