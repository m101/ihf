error handling.
in client, we want to log and fail ?
in server, we want to log only 
log_err()
log_info()
log_debug()

---- LATER ----

decoding :
in main(), read only the type of the request, and from there
make a choice. if it's a write, then read all the lenght needed
and pipe it directly to the process input FIFO without buffering
